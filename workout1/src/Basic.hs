-- swap the components of the input tuple
p2 :: (a,b) -> (b,a)

p3 (a,b) (x,y) = ((a+x), (b+y))

-- combine two pairs into a tuple with four components

p4 (a,b) (c,d) = (a,b,c,d)

----------------------------------------------------

p6 s = s++s

-- concatenate the input characters into a single string
p7 :: Char -> Char -> Char -> String
p7 a b c = [a] ++ [b] ++ [c]

-- Concatenate the strings with " is " in the middle.
-- So p8 "the dog" "lazy" should return "the dog is lazy"

p8 s1 s2 = s1 ++ " is " ++ s2

{- given x and y, print out the string with the string version of x, then " / ", and
   then the string version of y -}

p9 x y = show x ++ " / " ++ show y

{- print the rational number as numerator / denominator

   HINT: figure out how to extract the numerator and denominator.
   Then you can just call p9.
   You can read the docs on Rational, here:
   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Data-Ratio.html

-- Lists
--
-- Just call functions from Data.List to solve these.
-- You should not need to write any recursions yourself.
--
-- The docs for Data.List are here:
-- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Data-List.html
----------------------------------------------------

-- return a new list which is the concatenation of the three inputs lists
p11 :: [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> [a]
p11 xs ys zs = xs ++ ys ++ zs

-- return a list which is just like the input list except without
-- the first and last elements (it can fail if the list has fewer
-- than 2 elements)
p12 :: [a] -> [a]
p12 l = tail (init l)

-- append xs with the reverse of xs (so p13 "abc" should return "abccba")
p13 :: [a] -> [a]
p13 xs = xs ++ reverse xs
