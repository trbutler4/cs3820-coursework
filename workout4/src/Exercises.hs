    Be careful not to call 'log' in your code below, because this is
    a different function, from the Prelude.

    in PublicTests.hs (so you need to solve both to get points for
    these).

   Your job is to implement the rlelh function below, to be similar
   to rleh, but in the Logging functor, with the following log messages:
