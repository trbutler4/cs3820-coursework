-- You should just use combinators to write these functions.  Recursion
-- is not allowed.  You may use list comprehensions (which we did not
-- cover yet) if you want, but the problems can be solved without them.

-- Also you can see the docs for Data.List:

-- with the help of the function "even", return those elements of the given input list that are even

-- return the number of zero values in the input list (you can use the section (== 0) as a predicate to test for 0)

{- given a function and a list of inputs, construct the list of input-output pairs
   for that function on those inputs.  Hint: this is a good place to use an anonymous
   function, to go from a value of type a to a value of type (a,b). -}

{- given an element x and a non-empty list of lists l, return a new list of lists
   which is just like l except that it has an additional element at the
   head, namely x:h, where h is the head of l.

   So p13 x (y:ys) should equal (x:y):y:ys (in fact, that pretty much shows you
   the code you should write). -}

{- Using foldr and p13, construct the list of all sublists of the given
   input list.  So for [1,2,3], you would construct [[1,2,3],[2,3],[3],[]] -}
p14 :: [a] -> [[a]]
--p14 l  = foldr p13 l
p14 l  = foldr p13 [[]] l

{- Add corresponding numbers in the two lists, dropping any excess.

   So p15 [1,2,3] [10,20,30,40] should return [11,22,33]

   Hint: use zipWith -}
p15 :: Num a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
p15 = zipWith (+)

{- compose corresponding functions from the two lists,
   creating a list of the resulting compositions.  If one
   list is longer, drop the excess.

   Hint: again, use zipWith -}

p16 l1 l2  = zipWith (.) l1 l2
